# üåØ Burrito Optimization Game

This repository contains solutions and analyses for the **Burrito Optimization Game**, focusing on predictive and prescriptive analytics to optimize truck placement and demand fulfillment. Using **Python** and **Gurobi**, the project solves various optimization problems and explores strategic insights for improving operational decisions.

---

## üìã Project Overview

### **Objective**
Optimize the placement of burrito trucks and the allocation of demand to maximize profit while analyzing trade-offs and operational constraints.

---

## üîç Problem Details

### **1. Predictive Analytics**
- **Goal**: Estimate a function \( f(d) \) to predict the fraction of demand traveling a distance \( d \) for a burrito.
- **Approach**: Fit a predictive model using provided data to determine the relationship between distance and demand.

---

### **2. Optimization Problem**
- **Goal**: Set up and solve an integer programming (IP) model to:
  1. Place trucks at optimal locations.
  2. Allocate demand from buildings to trucks.
  3. Maximize overall profit.

#### **Constraints**:
1. Truck placement limited to specified locations.
2. Unlimited truck capacity in the base model.
3. Demand allocation scales based on distance.

#### **Scenarios**:
- Increased ingredient costs across days.
- Limited truck capacity with and without multiple trucks per location.
- Comparison of solutions under different capacity assumptions.
