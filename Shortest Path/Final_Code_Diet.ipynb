    "#### While the recommended meal plan in part b) is mathematically optimal in terms of cost minimization and meeting nutritional requirements, it presents several practical challenges for a child’s daily intake. These challenges arise due to issues such as redundancy in food items, lack of variety, portion sizes,  and unrealistic consumption patterns. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundancy in Food Categories: The plan includes both '2% Lowfat Milk' and 'Skim Milk' in the same day, which is not typical for a child’s daily intake. Incorporating both 2% Lowfat Milk and Skim Milk in the same day complicates meal planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of Variety Across Meals: With a limited selection of food items, it would be challenging to create three distinct meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—without repeating the same items. For example, heavy reliance on potatoes and oranges would limit the variety needed to make meals more appealing and varied in taste and texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excessive Quantities of Certain Foods: The model suggests consuming over 3 servings of 'Baked Potatoes' and 4.5 servings of 'Oranges,' which is unrealistic for a child’s single-day intake. While the meal plan meets nutritional requirements, it may not be appetizing or practical to consume such large quantities of specific foods in one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impractical Portion Sizes: Some of the recommended servings, such as 0.157 servings of 'White Rice' or 0.0941 servings of 'Banana,' are not practical for preparation or consumption. These fractional servings would need to be rounded to feasible amounts, which could slightly alter the nutritional intake and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The team introduced penalties for not incorporating a wider variety of foods into the objective function. We classified the food items into broader food groups to promote more variety in the daily meals, and we established constraints for the maximum and minimum number of food items in each food group.\n",

    "### [ Answer to D - Part 2/2 ]\n",
    "#### Principal Harper expressed concerns that children don’t enjoy eating the same meal every day. To address this, we developed a 7-day dietary plan with relaxed constraints, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Day 1\n",
    "#### - Total Cost: $1.98 per day\n",
    "#### - Food Items:\n",
    "- White Rice: 0.70 Servings\n",
    "- Potatoes, Baked: 2.00 Servings\n",
    "- Oranges: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Banana: 2.00 Servings\n",
    "- Carrots, Raw: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Wheat Bread: 2.00 Servings\n",
    "- White Bread: 2.00 Servings\n",
    "- Macaroni, cooked: 0.76 Servings\n",
    "- Bagels: 1.03 Servings\n",
    "- Lettuce, Iceberg,Raw: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Pork: 0.70 Servings\n",
    "- Poached Eggs: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Beef: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Scrambled Eggs: 0.30 Servings\n",
    "- Skim Milk: 1.69 Servings\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "#### Even with relaxed constraints, the limitations remain significant. In this 7-day plan, variety was introduced at the expense of not fulfilling the minimum requirement for calcium. Despite this compromise, we were only able to create one day without spaghetti.\n",
    "#### The team recommends two possible actions for Principal Harper:\n",
    "1. Hire a skilled cook who can creatively prepare more varied meals using the existing food items provided by the model.\n",
    "2. Expand the list of available food items to give the model more flexibility in creating varied daily combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without increasing the diversity of food options, it will be challenging to introduce meaningful variety in meals, even if some nutritional requirements are sacrificed."
